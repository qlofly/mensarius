### Functional
+ **List books** - a basic function for listing all the books.
+ **Display book info** - basic book information selector function.
+ **Create new record** - insert a new record into specific book.
+ **List records** - just select all the records.
+ **Sort records** - selecting and sorting some records.
+ **Delete a record(s)** - removing a record, or records.
+ **Export** - save the results of the listing.

These functions should be mixed up and accessible from different positions, for example, delete all records from the sort result.
This aspect should be talked over in which individual situation.



Please, separate all the functions in different files, so they don't mix up and get too complicated, remember about the style guide.
